# Multivariate Data Analysis

This repository is the collection of my assignments that I've completed during the course "Multivariate Data Analysis", Industrial Engineering, Korea University.

Each file includes the following:
- Assignment announcement file
- The dataset used in .csv format (Mostly found on Kaggle)
- Code written
- Final Report in .pdf format (download to view Korean)

All codes were written in R.

Special Thanks to Professor **Pisung Kang** of School of Industrial Management Engineering, Korea University, for giving me an A.
